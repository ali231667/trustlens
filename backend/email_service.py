# ============================================================
# TrustLens — Email Service (account verification codes)
# ============================================================
#
# Sends real email through Gmail's SMTP server using a Gmail "App Password"
# — not the Google Cloud Console / Custom Search API path that caused
# billing trouble earlier in this project. This is a personal Gmail account
# setting (2-Step Verification → App Passwords), completely free, no
# billing account involved at all.
#
# If GMAIL_ADDRESS / GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD aren't set in .env yet, sending
# fails loudly with a clear message rather than pretending to succeed —
# consistent with this project's "never fake it" rule.

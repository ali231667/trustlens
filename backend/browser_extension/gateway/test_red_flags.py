"""
Tests for the rule-based red-flag detector.

Two halves, and the second matters more:

1. Scam text fires the right flags.
2. **Ordinary creator captions fire nothing.** A false positive escalates a
   badge on an innocent post, which is the failure a user actually notices
   and loses trust over. Missing a subtle scam is the cheaper error, because
   the category model is still watching in parallel.

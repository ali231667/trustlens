"""
The post checker — the `/check-text` service the gateway expects on port 8001.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--------------------
The gateway was originally written against a separate post-checker project
that was never delivered to this repo, so content checking in the extension
has always been dead. This replaces it by wrapping the misinformation
classifier **that the main TrustLens site already uses** — the fine-tuned
XLM-RoBERTa in `backend/misinfo_classifier/`.

That choice is deliberate. Wiring in a second, different text model would
mean the extension and the website could disagree about the same caption,
which is exactly the inconsistency this project has been avoiding. Same
model, same weights, one answer.

WHAT IS AI HERE AND WHAT IS NOT
-------------------------------
- The **category** (credible / financial_scam / health_misinformation / ...)
  comes from the trained XLM-RoBERTa model. That is genuine machine learning,
  77% accuracy on a held-out test set.
- The **red flags** come from `red_flags.py`, which is hand-written regular
  expressions. That is not AI and must never be described as such.

Both are reported separately on purpose, because `analyzer.py` deliberately
trusts the flags more than the category — see its docstring for the measured
reason why.

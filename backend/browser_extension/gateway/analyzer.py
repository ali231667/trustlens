"""
Verdict logic, how the raw module outputs become one badge on the screen.

This file holds the judgement calls, kept apart from the plumbing in clients.py
so the reasoning is reviewable in one place.

Two decisions drive everything here, and both come from the modules' own
measured weaknesses rather than from taste:

1. **The red-flag layer is trusted more than the category label.**
   The post checker's own evaluation shows the category model degrades badly on
   real caption text (health-misinformation recall 0.10, political propaganda
   over-firing on ordinary civic sentences) while staying ~0.85 confident, it is
   confidently wrong, not uncertain. Its red flags are pattern matches on what the
   text *does* (guaranteed returns, urgency, "DM me", pay-off-platform), which do
   not degrade the same way. So a category alone never raises the badge past
   "caution"; corroboration by red flags is what makes it a warning.

2. **Absent evidence is reported, never silently scored as innocent.**
   A reel whose audio could not be transcribed is "not checked", not "clean".
   Collapsing those two states is how a trust product ends up vouching for
   something it never looked at.

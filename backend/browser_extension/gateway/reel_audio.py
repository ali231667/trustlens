"""
Reel audio -> text, inside the gateway.

The gateway used to hand this to a separate transcriber service on port 8000
(Module 12, Ali's). That service is not on this machine, and port 8000 is the
TrustLens website's own port anyway, so "Listen to audio" could only ever fail.

This does the same job in-process with faster-whisper (Whisper, re-implemented
on CTranslate2; runs on CPU). The video comes from the direct CDN link RapidAPI
returns for the reel, so no browser cookies, yt-dlp or page scraping are needed.

What this is and isn't, for the panel: Whisper is a pretrained speech
recognition model used as-is (not trained by us). Its output is only text; the
judging is still done by our own misinformation classifier and red-flag rules.

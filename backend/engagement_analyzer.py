# Engagement score as a smooth curve of (rate / benchmark), instead of the old
# 4-step staircase (20 / 50 / 75 / 90). With steps, a Macro account at 0.74%
# scored 20 and at 0.75% scored 50 — a 0.01% difference moving the final
# Trust Score by ~8 points. The curve passes through the old step values at
# the MIDDLE of each old band (ratio 0.25 -> 20, 0.75 -> 50, 1.25 -> 75,
# 2.0 -> 90), so scores don't shift on average; only the cliffs are gone.
